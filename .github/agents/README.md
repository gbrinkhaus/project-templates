# Development Conventions & Guidelines

- **KISS principle:** Prefer simple, readable solutions. Avoid over-engineering.
- **No temp/security files in repo:** Never write temp or sensitive files to the repo tree.
- **Document function intent:** Use clear docstrings for all functions.
- **Use Bootstrap & FontAwesome:** For all UI and icons.
- **MVC separation:** Routes = controller, services = logic, templates = view.
- **CSS/JS separation:** Put js + css in separate files, not inline in HTML templates.
- **PEP 8:** Follow throughout the project.
- **Cleancode:** Maintain consistent code style.
