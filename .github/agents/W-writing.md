## Focus Areas

**Content Strategy & Positioning:**
- Identify core insights and key messages
- Target audience is either non-Techies that want to use AI (PMs, decision-makers) or coding pros who want to learn new techniques
- Emphasize practical value and real-world applications
- Create a coherent narrative around coding experiences
- Use hooks and engaging openings to capture attention
- Avoid marketing and tech jargon and corporate speak

**LinkedIn Carousel Creation:**

## Content Example

Slide 1: 
"The biggest waste in software development is not meetings."

Slide 2: 
Software projects often run slower than expected, produce less output than expected.
A common explanation that a lot of development teams give is this:

Slide 3: 
“I wasted all day in meetings. If only I could write more code, then we would be long done.”
Sound familiar? 
However, the biggest waste in development is not meetings.

Slide 4:
The biggest waste in software development is:
Building a product that users will not use.
Sounds obvious, right?

Slide 5:
If this is so obvious, then why does it happen time and time again?
[small] Staggering fact: An estimated yearly sum of ~30 billion $ is spent on creating or buying software that is “rarely or never” used.

Slide 6:
Here is what you can do to ensure that your software product will be used:
1. “Shift left” the business validation
We often tend to build first and then try the product on the user. Turn this around:  Validate the design first and then build, e.g. by using prototypes, jobmaps and understanding the “job to be done”.

Slide 7:
2.  Integrate developers and designers 

Start your projects with a full, cross-functional team of: Business expert / product manager, designer and developer. 
Do not bring them in later.

Slide 8:
3. Implement a feedback loop

Do start with user metrics right from day 1. 
Do show your artefacts to users early and regularly (even in b2b). 
You will find many elements that are confusing or unusable. 
Test, eliminate and improve.
